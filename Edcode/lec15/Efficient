Writing Efficient programs

1. Programming cost
	a. How long does it take to develop
	b. How easy is it to read,modify, maintain (*)

2. Execution cost 
	a. How much time does your program take to execute
	b. How much memory does your program require

Modules and Encapsulation

Module: A set of methods that work together as a whole to perform some
		tasks or set of related tasks.

A module is encapsulated if its implementation is completely hidden

can be accessed only through a documented interface.

Abstract Data type ADT

Application Programming Interface API

API of an ADT the list of constructors and methods,
including desciptions of the effect of each

API consists of syntactic and semantic specification

1. Compiler verifies that syntax is met
2. Tests help verify that semantics(logic) are correct

Implementing Special Cases:

1. Extension
The case inhert the base case

2. Delegation 
Create a new base case, then making action on the instance 

3. Adaptation

Delegation vs Extension 

1. Safe to use inheritance within a package

2. Safe to extend classes designed and documented for extension

View

View provides a look inside actual data structure
