order of growth

Asymptotic notation to describe order of growth 

Big O: Used for bounding above (less than)

Big Omega: Used for bounding below (greater than)

Big Theta: Used for bounding both above and below (equals)

Big-Theta: R(N) belongs to Theata(F(N)) 

There exist positive constants k1 and k2 s.t. 

k1 . f(N) <= R(N) <= k2 . f(N)

for all values of N s.t. greater than some N0.

ex see python graph

Big O: R(N) is less than or qual to f(N)

R(N) belongs to O(F(N)) 

There exist positive constants k s.t. 

k1 . R(N) <= k . f(N)

for all values of N s.t. greater than some N0.
