Subtype Polymorphism

Polymorphism: "providing a single interface to entities of different types"

static type: compile-time type

dynamic type: run-time type

Dog D = ShowDog()

Dog is complile-time type

Showdog is the run-time type

A typing Puzzle 

Two classes 

1. Dog: Implements bark() method

2. ShowDog: Extends Dog, overritdes bark method 

Summarize is-a relationship 

Every ShowDog is-a Dog

Every Dog is-an Object 

Every Types in java are a subtype of Object

Interface inheritance: what (the class can do)

Implementation inheritance: how (the class does it)

Every method in an interface must be public 

unless with keyword default, a method will be abstract.

Interface details

Can provide variables, but they are public static final

final value can never change, used for constant gravity = 9.8

A class can implement multiple interfaces

Interface summay 

1. Cannot be instantiated - no new EdList

2. Can provide either abstract or concrete methods
	a. Use no keyword for abstract methods
	b. Use default keyword for concrete methods 

3. Can provide only public static final variables

4. Can provide only public methods.
