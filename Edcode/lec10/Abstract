Abstract classes are an intermediate level between interfaces 

1. Cannot be instantiated

2. Can provide either abstract or concrete methods 

difference between interface-opposite
a. Use abstract keyword for abstract methods 
b. use no keyword for concrete methods

3. Can provide variables(any kind)

4. Can provide methods (any kind)

Abstract Classes vs Interfaces

Interfaces: 

1. Primarily for interface inheritance. Limited Implementation
2. Classes can implement multiple interfaces 

Abstract classes:

1. Can do anything an interface can do
2. Subclasses only extend one abstract class

Suppose we wants to write a function max() that returns the max of any array regardless of type.

Object cannot be compared to other object with > sign

bad way of fix write max method in dog class: Need to write tons of method for other classes

Solution create an interface that guarantees a compaison method

Have Dog Implement this interface 

Write Maximizer class in terms of this interface.

Benefits: 1. No need for array maximuzation code in every type
		  2. Code that operates on multiple types
