Abstract Data Type(ADT) is defined only by its operations, not by its implementation.

The implementation can be in any format

ex.

Stack ADT

push(int x): puts x on top of the stack

int pop(): Removes and returns the top item from the stack.

we can build in Linked List or Array

Java Libraries 

The buil-in java.util package

1. Interfaces: ADTs(lists, sets, maps)

2. Abstract classes: Provides default implementations for some methods

3. Implementations: Concrete classes you can use.

The most important interfacrs in the java.util library extend the Collection interface

1. Lists of things

2. Sets of things

3. Mappings between items
	Maps also know as associative arrays, dictionaries(in Python)
