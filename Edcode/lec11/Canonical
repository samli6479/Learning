Java A package is a namespace that organize classes and interfaces.

Need to creates a directory to put the files.

../ move back to the upper directory

ex. DogLanuch

package ug.ed.animal

then move all files under ug/ed/animal

make sure the folders are under java classpath

execute it by put java ug.ed.animal.DogLaunch

External use

public class ExtDogLaunch {
	public static void main(String[] args){
		ug.ed.animal.Dog d = new ug.ed.animal.Dog("John", "Hairy", 55);
		System.out.println(d);
	}
}

Packages 

A package is a namespace that organizes classes and interfaces.

Naming convention: Package name stats with website address(backwards)

If used in from another class in same package can just use the simple name

Import class 

ex import org.junit.Assert;

import static lets import static members of a class

ex import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;

java -d flag to generate the appropriate folders;
