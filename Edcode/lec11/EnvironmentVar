Dependencies

Java classes may be dependent on other classes 

Environment Variables 

Every program running on your computer has access to the system's "environment variables"

The variable preset up for use in java

The CLASSPATH

The java compiler and interpreter assume there is an environment variable called CLASSPATH

and look in those folders for dependecies.

* MEANS LOOKING AT .class files and .jar files

./ means current directory

../ means directory one up

Java interpreter 

Gets a command line argument specifying the class to execute 

Use CLASSPATH variable to try to find that file

Naming Conflicts

Dog.class in current directroy and the higher directory

The file in current directory runs

-cp The command gives current class path

You order the dependicies in order and the interpreter search things in the order

-cp
