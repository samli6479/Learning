Declaration and instantiation

objects are instantiated using new keyword

Objects are either: 

   Instances of a class
   Arrays

int[] a; 

Declaration creates a simple container intended only for storeing a reference
Instantiation creates a new Object
Assignment puts the address of this new Object into container 

The object itself is anoymous

reassign a to something else, never able to get the object back

When we have empty constructor nothing happened

Java allow null references 

null references does not have instance variables

passing variables to a function is the same of assign them

Java is pass by value, the exact contents of the container in the outside frames are delivered
to the container in the function
