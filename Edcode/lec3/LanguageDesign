Programming Language Design 

Decision #1: Number Limits

Why have number limits 

A programming language needs a compiler(or interpreter)

1. Translates human readable code into something easy for computer to execute

2. Fixed size guarantees consistent program speed
a. Computers think natively in numbers smaller than some fixed size 
b. On a 64-bit machine dealing with numbers greater than 64-bits is much slower

Decision #2: Handling Overflow

1. How to handle operations that overflow their bounds?

C/C++: Not defined by the language

Java: the number after the largest number is the smallest number 

Binary Representations of Integers

Compare to the base 10 system

402 on 10 = 10^2*4+10^1*0+10^0*2 = 100*4+10*0+1*2 = 402

1011 on 2 = 2^3*1+2^2*0+2^1*1+2^0*1 = 8*1 + 4*0 + 2*1 + 1*1=11

100011 on 2 = 2^5*1+2^4*0+2^3*0+2^2*0+2^1*1+2^0*1 = 32*1+16*0+8*0+4*0+2*1+1*1
			= 32+2+1 = 35

addition in Binary

	35			100011
+	 2		   +	10
=	37		   =100101


Machine Structure 

The CPU of a computer has dedicated chips for operations like adding.
	Takes in fixed number of bits
	Each bit is delivered by a wire that has either a low(0) or high voltage(1)

8-bit computer has 8 input wire and 8 output wires

problem

computer 			actual
	11111111		11111111
+	00000001	 +  00000001
=   00000000     = 100000000

Truncation

When performing arthmetic operations, simply truncate the number To N bits

-5 in 4 bits

  0101
+ 1011
= 0000


Two Complement

To negative a number, flip the bits add one.

Given a 3 bit number, we can represent at most 8 distinguish numbers

US - unsigned     S - signed

0 is postive , 1 is negative for the first digit from left

Each integer type in Java has a range of posible values

byte, short, int, long  signed

8   , 16,    32,   64    

char 	unsigned

16 

Integer Literals

To get a long, append an L.

System.out.println(2131L+1L);     When printing java does not print
