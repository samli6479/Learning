Method Overloading in Java

Java allows multiple methods with the same name, but different parameters.

This is called method overloading.

Downsides

1. Source code files are unnecessarily long.

2. Mode code to maintain: One change made to one must made to other

Hypernyms Hyponyms and Interface Inheritance

Hypernym is a class word define a categories of objects

Hyponym is the sub object in A Hypernym

Animal is Hypernym of dogs and dog is Hyponym of animal.

Represent is relationship : Dog is animal.

Hyponymic Relationships in Java

SList and AList are both List

List is Hypernym of SList and AList

Expressing in Java two-step:

1. Define a reference type for hypernym

2. Specific the objects are hyponyms of that type.

ex. List- AList
		- SList

1. Define all methods the type able to do.

2. use implements keyword to tell them act.
   Mark each method with the override tag

Method Overriding 

If a subclass has a method with the same signature as superclass
the subclass method overrides the super class method

@Override
It is just a singal to other programmer

Interface Inheritance
The usage of the implements keyword "interface inheritance"

1. All sub-classes inherit the interface from their super-class

2. Intergace consists of all the method signatures.

3. Such relations can be multi-generational 

1. CollectionList-EdList-AList
						-SList

Copying the Bits

2 contradictory facts

#1 When you set x = y or pass a parameter you are just copying the bits

#2 A memory box can only hold 64 bit addresses for the appropriate type

If X is a superclass of Y then memory boxes for X may contain Y.

ex. An SList is a List
	Then List variabls can hold SList addresses.
