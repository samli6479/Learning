Variables and Objects

Variables 

When a variable is declared, we get a box of bits to hold one item of its declared type

The box may only hold values of its declared type

1. One of primitives (int, double, ...)

2. References to an Object of a particular type.

Objects are either: 

1. An instance of a class

2. An array

Arrays

1. A fixed integer length(cannot change!)

2. A sequence of N memory boxes where N = length, st: 
    a. All of the boxes hold the same type of value(and have same # of bits)
    b. The boxes are numbered 0 through length-1.

arrays are anonymous

1. One reference when its created
2. Reassign loss the array

Can access box with A[i]

Instantiated array

1. x = new int[3]; contain 3 int boxes

2. y = new int[] {1,2,3,4,5};

3. int[] z = {9,10,11,12,13};  only worked for declare

Comprise: 1. A length field, A sequence of N boxes, where N = length

System.arraycopy(b,0,x,3,2);

b - Source array

0 - Start position in source

x - Target array

3 - Start position in target

2 - Length of array to be coppied - 2 units include the starting position

Array Boxes Can Contain References to Arrays
