Ordered Linked List

A -> B -> C -> D -> E -> F ->G

Worst Case		Contains 	Insert

Linked List    Theata(N) 	Theata(N)

Bushy Binary Search Tree

		K
	E		V
B 	  G   P    Y

Worst Case		Contains 	Insert

Linked List    Theata(N) 	Theata(N)

Bushy BSTs	 Theata(Log N)	Theata(Log N)

Limitations: 

1. Items must be comparable

2. Maintaining bushiness is non-trivial

3. Theata(Log N) can we do better

Unordered Array

Extreme Approach:

All data is really just bits

1. Use data itself as anarray index
2. Store True and fakse in the array

Downsides of this approach:
Extremely wasteful of memory
Need some way to generalize beyond integers

Fast in contant time Array;
