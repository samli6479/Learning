When build these, K might not have a compare to method

Then we are forced to extends compare object to every class

Java have built-in Compareable

Can use extends keyword as a type upper bound

Something that is or is a subclass of type

ex. public static <K extends Comparable<K> ,V>  K maxKey(ArrayMap<K,V> am)

K has to be Comparable or a subclass of Comparable

ONly allow use on ArrayMaps with comparable keys. 

Any ArrayMap you give must have actual parameter type thay is a subtype of Comparable<T>

Comparable<T> Implemented by Integer, String
