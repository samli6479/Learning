Rotation:
	Can shorten a tree
	Preserves search tree property

Given an unbalanced tree, a dequence of rotations will yield a balanced tree

Red-black Tree

Left-Leaning Red Black Tree  LLRB

BST such that
1. No node has two red links
2. Every path from root to a leaf has the same number of black links
3. Red links lean left

2-3 Tree

Node have maximum 2 elements and 3 children

There exist an isometry between 
2-3 tree and LLRB

Isometry Maintenance (right-insert)

E insert S with a red link

   E        we rotate E and S       S
      S 						E     

The same as ES


Add F to LLRB E and A
                              ?
F +    E     E              E
     A     A    F         A    F   

Change the color of connection of ? and E from black to red
