Trouble with tree

1. Fundamental issue: Too lazy about where to store data

One solution:

Insert in random order
	Result in Theata(log N) height

Why don't do it.
	Data may come one at a time

The problem is adding new leaves

Solution never add new leaves
	Tree can never get imbalaced
	Grow the nodes instead of one element have a node with 3 elements together

	node :a now is node :a,b,c

What is the problem: 
	Leaf node become a linked list too much stuff

Solution?
	Set a cap on the number of items
	If more than cap, give an item to parent

Problem:
	Not binary tree 

Fix?
	If more than cap, give an item to parent
		Pulling item out and splits it into left and right
		More than two children
	m
e		oq
	n   p   rs

Contains(r):
	r >m, right
	r > o compare vs q
	r >q, right 

Examing a node might cost Z compares, but Z is a fixed number

Insert u

	m                           m
e 		oq					e 		oqs
	n   p  rstu					n 	p  r   tu

Suppose insert y, z

	m  							m
e       oqs					e       oqs
	n   p  r  tu                n   p    r  tuyz

	m                           mq
e 		oqsu                e    o   su      
	n  p  r tyz                n  p  r t  yz

If the root is maxed out
Then the move a element up as the new root
