Perfect Balance
Observation: Splitting-trees have perfect balance 

If we split the root every node gets pushed down by one level
If we split a leaf node or internal node then the height doesn't change

M: Max number of children
Height: Between log N/log M and log N / log 2

Max number of splitting operations per insert: H

Time per insert/contains: Theata(H), or Theata(log N)
