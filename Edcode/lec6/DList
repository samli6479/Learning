Improvement # 6

With the back pointer and previous pointer

Aka .back and .prev

[previous: , item: 5, next : ]
	[previous :, item: 17, next: ]
The next and the previous are linked together hence (doubly linked list)

# Warning

back sometimes points at the sentinel, sometimes points at a 'real' node.

Solution 1

Two Sentinel: one front, and one back

Solution 2

Circular Sentinel 

[previous: , sentiel item:, next ] the previous points to the last node's next 

and the last node's next is point to sentiel's next
